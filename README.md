# Book_List
Welcome to the Book List project GitHub repository! This repository hosts a dynamic and user-friendly web application that empowers you to effortlessly manage your reading list. Whether you're an avid reader, a student, or simply someone who loves books, this project provides a seamless solution for keeping track of your literary journey.

# Key Features:

# Book Addition:
With this project, you can easily add new books to your reading list. Input the book's title, author, and ISBN (International Standard Book Number), and watch your list grow with every addition.

# Effortless Deletion: 
We understand that reading preferences evolve over time. That's why we've made it straightforward to remove books from your list. A simple click of the delete button, and the book is no longer on your list.

# Smart Validation: 
To ensure accurate information is added to your reading list, we've implemented a validation check. If any of the input fields are left empty when you attempt to submit a new book, an alert will prompt you to fill in the missing details.

# Persistent Data: 
Your reading list is important to us, even when you close your browser. We've integrated local storage management to ensure that when you return to the application, your book list will be waiting for you, just as you left it. However, if you decide to remove a book by clicking the 'X' button, we'll respect your choice and update your list accordingly.

# Modern Design: 
This project boasts a sleek and user-friendly design, thanks to the utilization of HTML5 and ES6 JavaScript. The interface is intuitive, making it easy for users of all levels to navigate and manage their reading list efficiently.

Whether you're a coding enthusiast looking to explore the interplay of HTML5 and ES6 JavaScript or someone seeking a practical way to keep tabs on your reading materials, the Book List project has something to offer. Clone the repository, experiment with the code, and take control of your reading experience like never before. Happy reading and coding!
